# AdventOfCode2017
Advent of code challenge in 2017

Day 1 was completed using c++, which was the intended language of this years advent challenge. Sadly my complier for c++ got corrupted and amoung the anger I decided to do it in pyhton instead as that is the language my friend is doing this challenge in. So now I have a little healthy challenge to help push me through this 25 day process.
